# sde

Map each regular-expression match with the result of a command.

This script was written for MacOS,
but should work on any POSIX system with `perl` installed.

It's just a wrapper for a _perl_ one-liner
that I can't remember when I need it.

The name `sde` meant something to me once,
but I can't remember what anymore.
It's likely a play on "sed".
I'll likely change it to something else at some point.

## Usage

```shell
sde <REGEX> [<COMMAND-STATEMENT>]
```

## Installation

This is just a script, just put it on your PATH.
Alternatively, you can copy the perl one-liner it wraps
into a function in one of your startup files.
