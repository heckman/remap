# remap

Map each regular-expression match with the result of a command.

It's just a wrapper for a _perl_ one-liner
that I can't remember when I need it.

This script was written for MacOS,
but should work on any POSIX system with _perl_ installed.

## Usage

```shell
remap <REGEX> [<COMMAND-STATEMENT>]
```

## Installation

This is just a script, just put it on your PATH.
Alternatively, you can copy the perl one-liner that it wraps
into a function in one of your startup files.

## Note

This script used to named `sde`,
likely a play on "sed",
but I couldn't remember why I named it that,
so I renamed it to `remap`, which makes more sense.
